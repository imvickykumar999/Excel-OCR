Idea from :
Microsoft Excel made this Project, so I thought I should Try !!!

Approach :
I used tessaract library to read text from image.
then appended those text into list and then write in rows and columns of excel file.

Working :
Click photo of excel hand made table either from PC webcam or Mobile Camera and
programme will convert that table into .csv file in Excel.
